# A Tool for faking APIs

## Used Packages

- json-server

## Description

Test your front-end against a full fake REST API.

## Steps

- You need to update `mockData` file first with all needed data you would like to mimic.
- run `npm run prelocalApi` to generate `db.json` file to use it later by json-server.
- run `npm run localApi` to up the api server and you can access it via http://localhost:5000
## File Structure

- `mockData.js` contains all fake data you would like to use it, and to be like the data from the real API.
- `createMockDb.js` read data from `mockData.js` and convert it to `db.json`.
- `db.json` contains the converted data from `mockData.js`, generated by `createMockDb.js` and will be used by `apiServer.js`.
- `apiServer.js`, contains the implementation of json-server routes.
